# SR Latch
There are two inputs for the SR Latch: S for set and R for reset, and Q the output. When S = 1, Q = 1. When S = 0, Q = 1, that is because the latch remembers the last input. So then when R = 1, Q = 0 and it resets.

# How it works
Coin Input
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d7b3edd-21f1-4fcd-89f7-9d3bdfb3b50a)
In this picture you press the switch making the circuit realize that a coin has been entered into the vending machine. 

Item Selection

In this picture the user presses another switch signaling to the vending machine that an item has been selected. 

Delayed Reset

In this picture the capacitor starts to charge and the reset is delayed a bit. 

Final reset and ready for next purchase

In this picture the ciruit is fully reset and ready for another coin to ender the vending machine and another selection process.

# Old School Vending Machine

Our circuit is a simplified version of this old vending machine because we only have one option to pick whereas for this vending machine there are multiple options and outcomes to get from the vending machine.
